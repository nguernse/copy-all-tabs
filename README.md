# About

This repo contains the browser extension for Copy All Tabs - C.A.T. *meow*.

You can find two versions:
- `Firefox - v2` - a `manifest v2` version of the add-on
- `Chrome - v3` - a `manifest v3` version of the add-on

Both extensions work the same.

# Notice

This repo is still a W.I.P. The extension will have continuous updates in the future and may include additional features as need demands.

With that said, the **MVP** of this extension is complete, which is copying all tab URLs to your clipboard.
